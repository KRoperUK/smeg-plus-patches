# smeg-plus-patches

Reverse-engineering notes and tooling for patching **PSA / Stellantis "SMEG+"**
infotainment firmware so the **AUX audio source is selected automatically** when a
signal appears — the thing you want when an aftermarket CarPlay/Android-Auto piggyback
(such as CarABC / AutoABC) feeds its audio into the head unit's AUX input.

Tested against: **Peugeot 208 (2015), SMEG+ iV1, hardware diversity `NAV`,
firmware `SMEG5.43.A.R2` (CD 26482, 19-09-17)** — but the same approach applies to the
non-NAV (`AUDIO_BT`) builds.

**Status:** a patched, contract re-sealed package has been flashed to a real unit and
accepted — the media check passed, the application image was written, and the
`IsAUXSRCAvailable()` change is confirmed working (AUX no longer greys out). The
**automatic switch itself has not yet been observed working**; that is the open question.
See [Hardware verification](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

## Background

The head unit's application is delivered as `AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin`: a **0x801-byte
header** followed by a **zlib stream** that inflates to a raw **PowerPC** image loaded
at `0x01000000`. The release also ships absolute symbol maps
(`Application/PKG/abs_symbols_base.txt.gz`) which line up with that image, so the
firmware can be patched by symbol rather than by blind search.

The firmware already contains the auto-switch logic, in
`C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE::HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()`, reached via the event chain:

```
audio server --DBUS--> C_BCM_HMI_AUDIO_CLIENT::AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED()
  -> internal message 0xcc -> HMI event 0x613dc
  -> HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged() -> SetMediaDeviceState()/ActivateSource()
```

Two things stop that from actually switching on some units:

1. `C_HMI_AUDIO_APP_BASE::IsAUXSRCAvailable()` only reports AUX as available when the
   vehicle configuration already has it and a signal is present.
2. `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()` **returns early if `GetMediaDevice(AUX)` fails**,
   before it ever calls `ActivateSource()`.

The patch set addresses both. See [`docs/ANALYSIS.md`](docs/ANALYSIS.md) for the full
write-up and [`docs/PATCHES.md`](docs/PATCHES.md) for exact addresses and bytes.

## Supported builds / patches

| build | app image | `IsAUXSRCAvailable` | `…StatusChnged +0x10c` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AUDIO_BT` (512) | `AUDIO_BT/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin` | `0x02247718` → `li r3,1 ; blr` | `0x023032e8` → `nop` |
| `AUDIO_BT_256` | `AUDIO_BT_256/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin` | `0x02247718` → `li r3,1 ; blr` | `0x023032e8` → `nop` |
| `NAV` | `NAV/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin` | `0x02247858` → `li r3,1 ; blr` | `0x02303428` → `nop` |

Patches are data-driven — see [`patches/aux-autoswitch.json`](patches/aux-autoswitch.json).

## Requirements

- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) — the scripts declare their own dependencies, so
  `uv run tools/<script>` needs no setup. See [Running the tools](docs/RUNNING.md).
- `ffmpeg` for audio conversion (mp3/ogg/flac/...); WAV needs nothing.
- Your own SMEG+ upgrade package, laid out as `SMEG_PLUS_UPG/…`
- `capstone` is only needed by the disassembly helper (`tools/ppcdis.py`).

## Usage

### 1. Inspect (optional)

```sh
python3 tools/unpack.py SMEG_PLUS_UPG/NAV/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin app_nav.bin
```

### 2. Patch a copy of the package

```sh
uv run tools/patch_smeg.py --src SMEG_PLUS_UPG --out SMEG_PLUS_UPG_mod
```

```sh
python3 tools/patch_smeg.py \
    --src SMEG_PLUS_UPG \
    --out SMEG_PLUS_UPG_mod
```

This inflates each app image, applies the patches (verifying the original bytes first),
re-deflates it, and rebuilds the whole checksum cascade:

```
f_BigQuick.bin -> f_BigQuick.bin.inf + smeg.inf + <module>_ctrl.bin -> ctrl.bin
```

Use `--only NAV` to patch a single variant, or `--patches my.json` for your own patch
set.

### 3. Flash

Put the modified package folder at the root of a **FAT32** USB stick and run the normal
SMEG+ update on the car (engine running). See [`docs/FLASHING.md`](docs/FLASHING.md).

## Development environment

The CLI tools need nothing but `uv` — each script declares its own dependencies, so
`uv run tools/<script>` just works. The GUI, tests and docs build want a virtualenv.
`.venv/` is not in the repo; create it once (Python 3.13, because Homebrew's `python3` is
3.14, where `ensurepip` is broken and PySide6 has no wheels):

```sh
uv venv --seed --python 3.13 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python PySide6 pytest zensical ruff
```

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/patch_studio.py        # the GUI
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests -q           # the test suite
```

Or use plain `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` for the tests alone.

Install the git hooks once — `pre-commit install` wires all three types:

```sh
pre-commit install       # pre-commit, commit-msg and pre-push
```

Lint, hygiene and the no-firmware guard run on every commit; the tests, a strict docs build
and a `bandit` security scan run on push, so a push that would go red in CI fails locally
first. See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Working with AI agents

Agents should start at [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md): the hard rules (no vendor firmware,
conventional commit titles, `main` is PR-only), how to run the tests and GUI, and the
firmware quirks that are easy to get wrong.

## Contributing

Conventional commit titles (they drive the release), and no vendor firmware in the repo —
see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Tests

`tests/` builds a **synthetic package from scratch** — no vendor firmware is
needed — and asserts the patch/repack path, the `expect` byte check, the CRC cascade
and the docs nav. Run them with `python -m pytest tests -q`; CI runs the same on every
pull request.
