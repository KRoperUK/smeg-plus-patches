# Analysis notes (archive)

!!! info "Archive — kept for provenance"

    These are the **original** reverse-engineering notes, recorded while first building the
    AUX auto-switch patch. They are preserved to show how the findings were reached, but
    several conclusions here have since been superseded by execution under the emulator.
    For the current state of play, prefer:

    - [The AUX chain](AUX_CHAIN.md) — the auto-switch chain, gate by gate
    - [Emulating the firmware](EMULATION.md) — what was proven by running the code
    - [Patch reference](PATCHES.md) — the shipped patches and their bytes
    - [The AUX signal path](AUX_SIGNAL.md) — how the signal is detected, and the
      switch-on-signal candidate
    - [The source scheduler](SCHEDULER.md) / [The audio module](AUDIO_MODULE.md) — close
      readings
    - [Firmware map](FIRMWARE_MAP.md) — what has been read, and how closely

    Where a section below has been corrected, an admonition points to the current page.

Reverse-engineering notes for the SMEG+ application, recorded while building the AUX
auto-switch patch. Everything here is derived from observing the author's own device
and firmware; **no vendor binaries are reproduced**. Addresses are for the
`SMEG5.43.A.R2` builds targeted in `patches/aux-autoswitch.json`.

## 1. Package layout

A SMEG+ upgrade package (`SMEG_PLUS_UPG/`) is a set of modules plus a manifest:

```
ctrl.bin                     root manifest: per-file CRC32 list for each module
contract.dat                 signed contract validated by the app, see MEDIA_PROTECTION.md
upgrade.out / upgrade_lib.out / UpgPlugin.out    the updater itself (PPC ELF)
BSP/SMEG_PLUS_{256,512}/     vxWorks.bin (RTOS), dbsystem.bin (40-byte descriptor)
RENESAS/FPComSMEG.mot        front-panel MCU firmware (Motorola S-record)
AUDIO_BT/  AUDIO_BT_256/     media partition tar + AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin
NAV/                         same, for navigation units
HARMONY/BigHarmony_N/        UI skins (BIG_HARMONY.bin + skins)
USERGUIDE/                   user-guide resources
```

Module checksums are recorded in `<module>_ctrl.bin`, and those files are themselves
checksummed in the root `ctrl.bin`. Any patched file therefore requires the whole cascade
to be recomputed — `tools/patch_smeg.py` does this.

## 2. The application image

`AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin` is:

```
0x0000..0x0800    header (version, sizes, segment descriptors, 0xdeadbeef markers)
0x0800            0x08 (compression marker)
0x0801..         a zlib stream
```

Inflating the stream yields the application image (`~32 MB` for `AUDIO_BT`,
`~40 MB` for `NAV`), loaded at `0x01000000`.

The media partition also ships absolute symbol maps under `Application/PKG/`
(`abs_symbols_base.txt.gz`, `abs_symbols.txt.gz`, `symbols_bsp.txt.gz`). The base map
lines up exactly with the inflated image — every symbol lands on a PowerPC function
prologue (`stwu r1,-N(r1) ; mflr r0`) — which is what makes symbol-level patching
possible.

## 3. Audio source model

Relevant classes/functions found in the base map:

```
C_MODULE_AUDIO::Get_aux_status / Set_aux_status / setAUXGain / Get_AUX_signal_status
Radio::Get_AUX_signal_status -> C_I2C_SMART_RADIO::Get_AUX_signal_status
C_MGR_SRC                     source manager (allocation, priorities, permanent sources)
C_HMI_AUDIO_APP_BASE          audio UI app  (IsAUXSRCAvailable, OnEventSelectAUX, …)
C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE          media UI app  (HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged)
C_BCM_HMI_AUDIO_CLIENT        DBUS client to the audio server
```

Two distinct statuses exist:

- `Get_aux_status()` → `t_srv_audio_aux_status`, gated by a module flag at `this+0x74`
  (set to 1 in `C_MODULE_AUDIO::Open()` when the config getter succeeds).
- `Get_AUX_signal_status()` → raw AUX signal detection.

`C_HMI_AUDIO_APP_BASE::IsAUXSRCAvailable()` consults both; that is what drives the AUX
entry grey-out / enable behaviour in the source list.

!!! warning "Corrected: `+0x74` is a lifecycle state, and `Get_aux_status` is a setting"

    `+0x74` is not a flag set in `Open()`. It is `st_audio`, the module lifecycle state:
    0 closed, 1 open, 2 radio restarted, 9 radio early-started, 10 radio started, `0x28`
    error (*read*). `Get_aux_status` returns `+0x8c`, the saved AUX input **setting**
    (`Auxiliary_Status`), not a signal. See [The audio module](AUDIO_MODULE.md).

## 4. Event chain

```
audio server
  --DBUS signal AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED-->
     C_BCM_HMI_AUDIO_CLIENT::AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED()
        -> C_DBUS_ClientInstantiate::SendMessage(0xcc)
           -> HMI event 0x613dc
              -> C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE::HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()
                 -> Get_aux_status()
                 -> GetMediaDevice(AUX)          <-- bails out here on failure
                 -> SetMediaDeviceState(AUX, 2) + C_HMI_SrcMgntBase::ActivateSource(true)
```

!!! warning "Correction: there are *two* AUX signals"

    Later analysis found that the DBUS interface `com/MM/BCM_Audio` carries **two**
    AUX notifications, not one:

    - `AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED` — used by the audio module's own mute
      management (`C_MODULE_AUDIO::Elab_AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED`).
    - `AUDIO_AUX_INPUT_STATUS_CHANGED` — and the HMI handler is named
      `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged` (**Input**), which points at this one.

    So the event chain above may be the *signal* path while the auto-switch handler is
    driven by the *input* path. Which one actually fires on the car is the decisive open
    question, and is exactly what the spy capture in [Cheatcodes](CHEATCODES.md) is for.

!!! failure "Corrected: the chain starts from the INPUT event, and the INPUT event is the setting"

    The diagram above is wrong at its first step. `C_BCM_HMI_AUDIO_CLIENT`'s
    `AUDIO_AUX_SIGNAL_STATUS_CHANGED` posts `0xcc`; its `AUDIO_AUX_INPUT_STATUS_CHANGED` posts
    `0xcb`, and `0xcb` is the message the media app dispatches to
    `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged` (*read*, disassembly). The INPUT event is raised when the
    saved AUX input setting is written, not when a signal appears. See
    [What the handler actually reacts to](AUX_CHAIN.md#what-the-handler-actually-reacts-to).

The handler is registered in the HMI event table (entry: size `0x2c`, event id
`0x613dc`, handler pointer, function size `0x290`, type `7`).

## 5. Why it does not switch

Observed on the target car: AUX is listed and greys out / re-enables with signal, so
availability and signal detection both work — but the unit never switches to AUX on its
own. The event handler contains an early return:

```
023032d0  bl      GetMediaDevice          ; type 5 = AUX
023032e8  419e014c beq cr7, +0x14c        ; if (!ok) return;   <-- before ActivateSource
```

If the AUX media device lookup fails, the function returns before doing anything. That
is the single early exit consistent with the symptom, and it is what the second patch
removes.

## 6. Hardkey path (for a possible later trigger)

The HMI keyboard layer exposes:

```
C_HMI_KeyboardMessage::GetVKeyPressedData / GetVKeyReleasedData
C_HMI_KeyboardMessage::GetVKeyKeepPressedData     (long press)
C_HMI_KeyboardMessage::GetVKeyRepeatData
C_HMI_KeyboardMessage::GetVKeySimultaneusData     (simultaneous keys -> chords possible)
```

so a long-press or chord trigger is representable in principle; the `SRC` key is handled
by `C_HMI_AUDIO_CHANGE_SOURCE_0X_Menu::HandleVCIKey` / `HandleNextSourceKey` and by
`C_HMI_AUDIO_APP_BASE::HandleKeyboardMessage`.

### Why "long-press SRC to select AUX" is not a small patch

Disassembly of the actual handlers makes this look much less attractive than the API
surface suggests:

- **The source menu never sees a long press.** `C_HMI_AUDIO_CHANGE_SOURCE_0X_Menu::HandleVCIKey`
  reads only `GetVKeyReleasedData()`. It switches on the released key code: `0x4f` and
  `0x20051` call `HandleNextSourceKeyEv()` (the SRC cycle), `0x51` synthesises a click on
  the focused item. There is no keep-pressed branch to extend.
- **The only long-press hook that fires is global.** `C_MENU_STATE::ProcessEscKeyLongPress()`
  is a single implementation for *every* screen; it emits a system notification command
  (id `0x12`) which the unit routes to the product-code / system-information view. That is
  the existing SRC long-press behaviour. Replacing it would change that behaviour
  everywhere, not just in the audio app, and would break the existing shortcut.
- **The steering wheel does not report it.** The wheel's SRC produces press/release but
  no keep-pressed event reaching the audio application, so there is nothing to bind on
  that key at all.
- **Upstream, the feature is unfinished.** The image carries the string
  `ESC LONG PRESS handling should be done!!!`, emitted from
  `C_MENU_STATE::HandleTouchEvent` — i.e. long-press handling has stub paths in this
  firmware.

**Conclusion:** not implemented, and not recommended as a first step. It is a
disproportionately invasive change for a convenience shortcut. With
`IsAUXSRCAvailable()` patched, AUX is already reachable through the ordinary SRC cycle —
the auto-switch is the real fix for the switching problem.

## 7. Integrity chain

Verified by recomputation and search:

```
f_BigQuick.bin  --crc32-->  f_BigQuick.bin.inf  ("CRC32: <signed decimal>")
                --crc32-->  smeg.inf             (BIGQUICK_CRC32: <signed decimal>)
                --crc32-->  <module>_ctrl.bin    (4-byte big-endian CRC for each file)
<module>_ctrl.bin --crc32--> ctrl.bin
```

`contract.dat` is not referenced by `upgrade.out` — which is what an earlier pass through
these notes concluded from. That was wrong: the **application image** validates the media
against it in `C_BCM_UPGRADE::CheckTrustedSource()`, and a package with a modified
application image is rejected because of it. See
[Media protection](MEDIA_PROTECTION.md).

## 8. Updater behaviour relevant to flashing

Strings in `upgrade.out` show the update is incremental:

- `manageBootRomUpdateAndReboot: BootRom already done.`
- `ManageRenesasUpdateAndReboot: Renesas version '%s' == Mot. File version '%s'` (skip)
- `ManageBigQuickUpdate: '%s' is a cantidate!` / `WriteNANDBigQuick … return OK`

so an already-updated unit will not rewrite BootROM/Renesas; the BigQuick application is
rewritten when its content differs from what is stored.

## 9. Caveats

- The media contract has been regenerated successfully and the resulting package was
  accepted by a real unit — see [Hardware verification](VERIFICATION.md). The
  `IsAUXSRCAvailable()` patch is confirmed working there.
- **The automatic switch is still unproven.** Removing the early exit in
  `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()` was a hypothesis; it has not yet been observed
  causing a source change. If it does not, the AUX status event is not reaching that
  handler and the fix belongs on a path that provably runs.
- The `AUDIO_BT` and `AUDIO_BT_256` patch sets are verified against their images but have
  not been flashed.
- Re-flashing the same version does not change the displayed version strings, so
  behaviour is the only reliable confirmation. Do not use System Information to decide
  whether a patch is installed.

## 10. The AUX event chain, verified in the NAV image

!!! info "This section is the original trace; [The AUX chain](AUX_CHAIN.md) is the current one"

    That page carries the whole chain gate by gate, including the links found since — the
    listener registration upstream of the dispatch, and the four gates inside the handler,
    most of them executed rather than read. Prefer it when you want the state of play; this
    section stays because it records how the dispatch was first found.

Traced in `nav_app_image.bin` against `nav_syms.txt` — use those **together**; the 32 MB
`app_image.bin` is the AUDIO_BT image and reading it with the base symbol map gives a
different `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged` address, which is an easy way to conclude the
NAV patch is pointing somewhere wrong when it is not.

```
audio server --DBUS msg 0xcb (203)--> C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE::HandleDBUSMessage()
                                      @ 0x02309398, case at 0x02309638
                                        cmpwi cr7, r0, 0xcb
                                        beq   cr7, 0x2309fbc
                                          -> 0x02309fcc  bctrl HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()

C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE::HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged()      @ 0x0230331c
  02303410  bl  GetMediaDevice(type, media_device&)
  02303428  beq cr7, 0x2303574     handler+0x10c — the shared return path, what we nop
  02303434  beq cr7, 0x230348c     the aux-sticky target
  0230345c  bl  SetMediaDeviceState(...)
  02303484  bl  C_HMI_SrcMgntBase::ActivateSource(bool)
```

The handler has exactly one direct caller — the DBUS dispatch — plus a vtable entry.

!!! warning "Corrected by emulation"

    This page previously concluded that removing `0x02303428` *does* reach
    `ActivateSource`. Executing the function proved otherwise, twice over: the branch is
    never taken in the first place (the AUX media device is registered unconditionally, so
    `GetMediaDevice` succeeds), and when it *is* forced to fail, the nop only reaches
    `SetMediaDeviceState` — `GetMediaDevice` leaves the source-manager field null on its
    failure path, so the guard at `0x02303468` returns instead. See
    [Emulating the firmware](EMULATION.md).

**The consequence:** the patch is not the problem. If the unit does not switch by itself,
DBUS message **203** is not reaching the media app. That points at the always-active hook
rather than more surgery inside the handler, and it is a hypothesis that can be settled by
logging received DBUS ids rather than by flashing something.
