# Running the firmware without a car

Every patch address in this project was found by reading disassembly, and every claim
about what a patch *does* was an inference from that reading. Inferences are where the car
trips came from.

`tools/ppcemu.py` executes the shipped image instead. It does not boot the unit — there is
no VxWorks, no display, no DBUS. It calls **one function at a time** on an emulated
PowerPC core, with a stack, a scratch region and stubs for whatever that function calls.
That is enough to answer the question a patch actually raises: *does control reach the
code I think it reaches, and under what conditions?*

Doing this to the AUX patches found that **one of the two edits in `aux-autoswitch` cannot
work, and never could**. The details are below.

## Why this is possible at all

The SoC is a **Freescale MPC5121e** — an e300 core, which is plain 32-bit big-endian
PowerPC. Unicorn's PowerPC backend runs it directly. There is no custom silicon to model
because we never execute anything that touches the peripherals: a function that would talk
to hardware is stubbed at its call site.

The application image is not encrypted either (see the [analysis notes](ANALYSIS.md)), so
`tools/unpack.py` produces exactly the bytes the CPU would fetch, based at `0x01000000`.

```sh
uv run tools/unpack.py SMEG_PLUS_UPG/NAV/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin app_nav.bin
uv run tools/ppcemu.py app_nav.bin --call 0x02247858 --arg 0x60000000 \
    --patches patches/aux-autoswitch.json --module NAV --trace
```

A whole comparison — six runs of a 39 MB image, stock against patched — takes well under a
second, so this belongs in the edit loop, not in a special session.

## What it can and cannot tell you

**Reachability is proof.** If the emulator shows a branch is taken, that branch is taken
for those register and memory values; the CPU has no opinion about where the values came
from.

**Behaviour is not.** A stub returning `0` is an assumption you wrote down, not something
observed on a car. The emulator makes assumptions *explicit and executable* — which is the
whole gain — but it cannot tell you whether the unit's real state matches them. Where a
finding below depends on a stub, it says so.

Unmapped memory is recorded rather than fatal: the emulator maps a zero page and notes the
access, so the list of "state this function expected to exist" falls out of a run.

## What it found

### 1. The `IsAUXSRCAvailable()` patch does what it claims

Stock, with a zeroed object, the function finds a null pointer at `this+0x50dfc` and takes
the failure path into the kernel. Patched, it returns `1` in two instructions. This one was
already confirmed on hardware; the emulator agrees.

### 2. The `+0x10c` early-exit patch is inert

This is the second half of `aux-autoswitch`, and it has never been observed doing anything
on a car. The emulator shows why — two independent reasons, either of which is sufficient.

**It patches a branch that is never taken.** The early exit fires when
`GetMediaDevice(mgr, AUX, &obj)` returns non-zero, and that call fails only when the AUX
media device is not registered. Registration was executed, not read:

```
C_HMI_MEDIA_APP_BASE init  @ 0x022bf934
  -> register devices      @ 0x022b833c        (unconditional; every early-out
                                                 branch in init rejoins before it)
       AddDevice(type 0) …(type 1)…(type 2)…(type 3)…(type 5)
       if (this->0x51450)  AddDevice(type 4)   <- the only conditional
```

Running that function fills the table with **types {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}** — AUX (type 5) among
them, unconditionally, with its source manager taken from `this+0x50e3c`, which is
allocated and stored unconditionally at `0x022bcac8`. So `GetMediaDevice(AUX)` succeeds,
the status is `0`, and the `beq` at `+0x10c` falls through with or without the patch.

**And if it were taken, the patch still would not help.** `GetMediaDevice` writes nothing
to its out-param on the failure path:

```c
int GetMediaDevice(mgr, type, out) {       // 0x022f3750
    status = -1;
    dev = FindDevice(mgr, type);           // 0x022f3608 — linear scan, count at mgr+0xc0
    if (dev == NULL) return status;        // -1, and *out is left exactly as it was
    out[0x00] = dev[0x00]; … out[0x10] = dev[0x10]; …
    return 0;
}
```

`out` is the local object the handler just zero-initialised, and `out[0x10]` is the source
manager the handler needs. Nopping the early exit lets execution continue with that field
still null — straight into the guard at `0x02303468`, which returns. The patch buys exactly
one extra call, `SetMediaDeviceState(AUX, 2)`, and then exits at the same place:

| AUX media device | stock | patched |
|---|---|---|
| absent | returns at `+0x10c` | returns at `+0x14c`, having called `SetMediaDeviceState` |
| present | reaches `ActivateSource` | reaches `ActivateSource` — identical |

The patch removes an early exit whose own precondition is what the following code depends
on. There is no configuration in which it reaches `ActivateSource` and stock does not.

!!! danger "Do not nop the source-manager guard as well"

    The obvious follow-up — also removing the `beq` at `0x02303468` — calls
    `ActivateSource` with a **null `this`**: `0x0230346c` loads that field straight into
    `r3`. On the HMI thread. Leave it alone.

### 3. The handler's real gates, in order

```c
void HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged(this) {       // 0x0230331c
    app = this->0x50df4;                           // 0x022ad2c0, a plain getter
    if (app == NULL) return;                       // gate 1  @ 0x02303358
    ctor(&obj);                                    // zeroes obj, obj[0x10] included
    GetAuxStatus(app, &signal);                    // 0x025cb258 — return value IGNORED
    state = (signal != 0);
    if (state == this->0x51449) return;            // gate 2  @ 0x023033d4  (change detector)
    this->0x51449 = state;
    if (GetMediaDevice(mgr, AUX, &obj)) return;    // gate 3  @ 0x02303428  (never taken)
    SetMediaDeviceState(mgr, AUX, 2);
    if (obj[0x10] == NULL) return;                 // gate 4  @ 0x02303468  (never taken
    ActivateSource(obj[0x10], true);               //          once gate 3 passes)
}
```

Two things in there matter beyond the patch:

!!! note "Setting, not signal"

    This section originally described the value gate 2 tests as the AUX **signal**. It is the
    saved AUX input **setting** (`C_MODULE_AUDIO+0x8c`), read from disassembly; see
    [What the handler actually reacts to](AUX_CHAIN.md#what-the-handler-actually-reacts-to).
    The runs below are unaffected — they fed the query a value — but their labels are.

**Gate 2 means the handler only acts on a transition.** An AUX setting that is already
non-zero when the state is first recorded produces no activation, because nothing changed.

**`GetAuxStatus`'s return value is discarded.** It returns `-1` without touching the
out-param if its proxy (`obj->0xc`) is null — and the handler reads the untouched local as
"setting 0". A failed query is indistinguishable from AUX being switched off, and
lands in gate 2 as "no change". That is a silent failure mode, and it is the shape of
failure that matches the symptom.

### 4. `aux-sticky` was broken, and only executing it showed that

The patch's second edit retargets the "AUX setting zero" branch (described at the time as
"AUX signal absent") to the shared return path, so an activated AUX is not handed back to radio
when that value drops. It shipped as
`b +0x140` — the right displacement, with the condition dropped. Unconditional, so the
branch was taken regardless of the signal, and the activate path immediately below it became
unreachable.

| bytes at `0x02303434` | setting becomes non-zero | setting becomes zero |
|---|---|---|
| `419e0058` (stock, `beq +0x58`) | activates | releases |
| `48000140` (shipped, `b +0x140`) | **does nothing** | does nothing |
| `419e0140` (fixed, `beq +0x140`) | activates | does not release |

Reading the patch does not show this; the displacement is correct and `+0x140` really is
the return path. Running it does, immediately. This is the case the emulator was worth
building for.

### 5. The logging is gated by one global, and it is zero

`Log_msg` begins `if ((GetLogMask() & level) == 0) return;`. `GetLogMask` reads a single
global at `0x036d42a8` — past the end of the image, so BSS, so **zero at boot** — and
exactly one instruction anywhere in the image writes it, through ten `SetTrace` wrappers
that are vtable entries only.

Emulating `Log_msg` directly: with the mask at 0, it bails after 47 instructions and never
reaches the formatting code; with the mask forced, it runs 271 and calls its sink.

**But the sink is stubbed.** `Log_msg` makes exactly two calls — `GetLogMask`, and then
`0x010346d0`, which is `li r3,0 ; blr`. That is the same address `diagnostic-logging`
redirects, so `0x010346d0` is not "the stub called instead of `Log_msg`" but **the sink
`Log_msg` itself calls**. Both halves of the firmware's logging end at the same no-op, and
forcing the mask only buys you the formatting before the message is discarded.

??? note "Correcting an earlier reading of this page"

    An earlier version of this page said the patched handler emits its log line. It does not;
    what was measured was execution reaching past the mask gate, which is not the same thing.
    Correcting that is what the emulator is for, and it is also a reminder that *reachability
    is proof and behaviour is not* — the caveat at the top of this page applies to conclusions
    drawn here too.

That has a direct consequence for `diagnostic-logging`, which redirects the ~6700
compiled-out call sites to the real logger: **on its own it emits nothing**, because every
redirected site lands in `Log_msg` and hits the same gate. The image has two logging
mechanisms and this one only unblocks the wrong half.

Flashing both patches is worse than either: `diagnostic-logging` repoints the sink at
`Log_msg`, so with the mask also forced the two call each other. One call re-enters
`Log_msg` three times before unwinding in emulation; on the unit that runs on every log
call in the firmware.

A working diagnostic needs `0x010346d0` pointed at something that really writes. That is
now `patches/diagnostic-logsink.json`: VxWorks `logMsg` at `0x00484a94`, whose signature
matches what the caller has already set up. Emulated, the patched sink jumps to that
address and the emulator reports an unmapped fetch — which is the expected result, since
the kernel is not part of the application image, and it confirms the branch target. Where
that output surfaces on the unit is still open. See [Patch reference](PATCHES.md).

### 6. One device type is unreachable firmware-wide

Device **type 4** is registered only when the byte at `this+0x51450` is non-zero. That byte
is written in exactly **two places in the entire 39 MB image** — both constructors, both
storing `0`. Nothing anywhere sets it. Whatever type 4 is (the surrounding evidence points
at Jukebox), the firmware as shipped can never register it.

This is worth knowing mainly as a warning: a device type being absent from the table is not
evidence about AUX, because at least one type is absent by construction.

## What this changes

The conclusion in the [analysis notes](ANALYSIS.md) — that the patch is not the problem and the DBUS
message is not arriving — **still stands, and is now better supported**. What changes is
the standing of the second edit: it is not "a fix that has not been confirmed", it is a fix
that provably cannot fire. Effort spent flashing it is spent.

The open question is upstream of this function entirely: is `HandleAudioAuxInputStatusChnged`
ever entered, and if it is, does the status query return a signal? The handler logs its own
name on every exit, so a working log would answer the first half at once — but as finding 5
above records, this build has no log output path, and giving it one is still open.

The whole chain, gate by gate, with the state of each link, is in
[The AUX chain](AUX_CHAIN.md). The short version: every link is a null check, the four
inside the handler have now been executed, and the one that has never been observed is the
first — whether the audio client's listener was ever registered. A single null pointer
there explains every symptom at once, which makes it the first thing to look for in the
log.

## Reproducing this

The tests in `tests/test_ppcemu.py` cover the emulator itself against assembled-in-test
images, so they run without any firmware. The findings above need your own package:

```sh
uv run tools/unpack.py SMEG_PLUS_UPG/NAV/AppBin/f_BigQuick.bin app_nav.bin

# 1. the IsAUXSRCAvailable patch, stock vs patched
uv run tools/ppcemu.py app_nav.bin --call 0x02247858 --arg 0x60000000
uv run tools/ppcemu.py app_nav.bin --call 0x02247858 --arg 0x60000000 \
    --patches patches/aux-autoswitch.json --module NAV

# 2. the device table — types registered, with the type-4 flag clear
uv run tools/ppcemu.py app_nav.bin --call 0x022b833c --arg 0x60000000
```

The handler comparison needs two stubs, so it is a short script rather than a command:

```python
import struct, sys

sys.path.insert(0, "tools")
from ppcemu import Emulator, SCRATCH
from unicorn.ppc_const import UC_PPC_REG_4

IMG = open("app_nav.bin", "rb").read()
DEV = SCRATCH + 0x9000
REAL = {0x022F3750, 0x02368080, 0x022F3608}  # GetMediaDevice, ctor, FindDevice


def run(patched, device_found):
    e = Emulator(IMG)
    if patched:
        e.apply_patch_file("patches/aux-autoswitch.json", "NAV")
    e.stub_all, e.stub_default, e.run_for_real = True, 0x60002000, REAL
    e.stub(
        0x025CB258,
        lambda uc: uc.mem_write(  # the AUX setting query returns non-zero
            uc.reg_read(UC_PPC_REG_4), struct.pack(">I", 1)
        ),
    )
    e.stub(0x022F3608, DEV if device_found else 0)  # FindDevice
    e.write(DEV, b"\x00" * 0x20)
    e.write_u32(DEV + 0x10, 0xC0FFEE00)  # the device's source manager
    e.call(0x0230331C, [SCRATCH])
    return e.reached(0x0273A248), e.call_sequence()  # ActivateSource?


for patched in (False, True):
    for found in (False, True):
        print(patched, found, run(patched, found)[0])
```
