# Releasing

Releases are automated with [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).
You do not edit version numbers or the changelog by hand.

## Commit messages

Because the repository squash-merges pull requests, **the PR title becomes the commit
message on `main`** — so the PR title must be a conventional commit.

| commit / PR title | release |
|---|---|
| `feat: add long-press SRC trigger` | **minor** — `x.Y.z` goes up |
| `fix: correct AUX gain default` | **patch** — `x.y.Z` goes up |
| `feat!: drop the availability patch` | **major** — `X.y.z` goes up |
| `fix!: change patch file layout` | **major** |
| `docs:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `chore:`, `ci:`, `test:`, `build:` | no release on their own |

A breaking change can also be flagged with a footer instead of the `!`:

```
feat: rework the patch definition format

BREAKING CHANGE: patches/*.json now requires a "base" field.
```

Anything hidden by `changelog-sections` (chore, ci, test, build) still appears in the
commit history but not in the changelog.

!!! tip "Check the title before you push"

    The Conventional-Commit format is **enforced** in two places — a `commit-msg` hook and
    a CI check on the PR title — both by `tools/check_commit_msg.py`. Getting it wrong
    silently produces no release, so validate it up front:

    ```sh
    python3 tools/check_commit_msg.py --title "feat: add long-press SRC trigger"
    ```

## What happens automatically

1. A push to `main` triggers `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
2. Release Please opens (or updates) a **release PR** containing the bumped
   `version.txt`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.release-please-manifest.json` and, for a `!`
   commit, a `⚠ BREAKING CHANGES` section.
3. Merging that PR creates the git tag (`vX.Y.Z`), the GitHub Release, and the
   changelog entry.

Because the branch ruleset allows merge/squash/rebase and requires linear history, the
release PR merges normally. The tag is not covered by the branch ruleset.

## Approving the release PR's checks

The branch ruleset requires the `test` check before anything merges to `main`.

There is one wrinkle: **a pull request created with the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not
trigger workflows automatically**, so the release PR's CI run arrives in
`action_required` and sits there. It has to be approved once, then the checks run
normally:

- **UI:** the PR shows a *Workflow(s) awaiting approval* banner — click **Approve and run**.
- **CLI:**
  ```sh
  RUN=$(gh run list --repo KRoperUK/smeg-plus-patches \
      --branch release-please--branches--main --workflow CI \
      --json databaseId,conclusion --jq '[.[]|select(.conclusion=="action_required")][0].databaseId')
  gh api -X POST repos/KRoperUK/smeg-plus-patches/actions/runs/$RUN/approve
  ```

!!! warning "This is expected behaviour, and approving it is deliberately a human's job"

    The `action_required` state is what GitHub does for any PR opened with the default
    `GITHUB_TOKEN` — it is the designed behaviour, not a fault to be worked around. The
    recipe above is written for a person; approving a release is a decision, not a chore.

    **Agents: do not automate this.** Do not call the approval API above, do not add a
    personal access token, and do not weaken the ruleset to let the release PR proceed.
    If you find the release PR sitting at `BLOCKED` with *no checks reported*, that is the
    expected state — say so and stop. Merging a release PR is a human's call too.

The alternative is to give Release Please a personal access token (so its PRs trigger
workflows like any other) — more setup, and a long-lived secret to hold.

Repository admins also have a `pull_request`-scoped bypass on the ruleset, so the release
PR can be merged directly if you would rather not approve the run.

## Configuration

- `release-please-config.json` — release type, changelog sections, version bump rules.
- `.release-please-manifest.json` — current released version (kept in sync by the bot).
- `version.txt` — the version file bumped by the `simple` release type.

!!! note "Pre-1.0 behaviour"

    `bump-minor-pre-major` and `bump-patch-for-minor-pre-major` are both `false`, so a
    breaking change takes the project to `1.0.0` rather than staying inside `0.x`. If you
    would rather stay pre-1.0, set `bump-minor-pre-major` to `true`.
